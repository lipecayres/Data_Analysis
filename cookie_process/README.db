# Data Visualization: Statistical Quality Control - Cookie Production Process

#### RESUMEE

The demand for food is growing in the world being driven by the increase in population. The food industry, more precisely the cookie manufacturing companies, are inserted in a market that generated 140 billion dollars in sales and grew 5.49% in 2020 (ABIA, 2020). 

To keep up with the growth of this increasingly competitive industrial sector, biscuit manufacturers need to apply quality tools to improve their processes. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of the cookie manufacturing process in a large food industry based on statistical quality control. 

Statistical quality control consisted of the following approaches: Stability Analysis; Capability Analysis and Loss Function Analysis. In the stability analysis, the Control Charts for Attributes were used. In the capability analysis, capacity and performance indices were used, in addition to the analysis of the sigma level of the process.

The quality loss analysis evaluated the process through the Taguchi loss function. The analyzes concluded that the process is stable, and can be characterized as a capable process (𝐶𝑝𝑘 > 1)  with a sigma level of 3,89𝜎, in addition to presenting small losses in the process (k = R$2,04).  The evaluation of the sigma level indicates that the process can improve to sigma level = 5,85𝜎 with actions only to centralize the process average to the target value, which would represent an improvement of 1,96𝜎.

* Stability Analysis of the cookie manufacturing process
* Capability Analysis of the cookie manufacturing process
* Loss Function Analysis of the cookie manufacturing process

#### Variables analyzed
The main objective of this project is to analyze the performance of a cookie manufacturing process, specifications and characteristics. Looking for it, the chosen variables were:

* p Control Chart
* beta  Control Chart
* CUSUM Control Chart
* EWMA  Control Chart
* Capacity (Cp) and Performance (Cpk) Process Indicator
* Taguchi Loss Function 

### Results:

#### Stability Process Analysis: 

This analysis shows four differente Control Charts - p, beta, CUSUM and EWMA - to be sure that the process is really stable and has no special causes (ocurrences out of the control limits). 

p Chart: No ocurrences of special causes, so the process is stable.

beta Chart: There's an ocurrence out of the control limit.It's a unique ocurrence between controled ocurrences, so the conclusion is that this ocurrence is a false alarm. So, we also can conclude that beta chart get a stable analysis.

#### Capability Analysis

The process capability analysis considering the specification limits defined by t = 0.136, LIE = 0.10 and LSE = 0.17 provided the capability indices 𝐶𝑝 = 1.4756 and 𝐶𝑝𝑘 = 1.1509 being adherent to the results of the company's quality indicators

#### Taguchi Loss Function

For this cookie manufacturing process, the metrics recorded are: production of 7168 cookies per minute; cost of loss per unit of R$0.0051; process target value (t) of 0.136 (13.6% cookie weight loss); and a tolerance variation (delta) of 0.05. The definition of these metrics established a quality loss coefficient (k) of R$ 2.04 and a Taguchi loss function that can be represented by the equation LF = 2.04 * (y – 0.136)^2

### Conclusion

Stability Analysis: It allowed a diagnosis of a stable process by using robust control charts for monitoring, allowing a better precision of the process, adhering to the results of the company's quality indicators.

Capability Analysis: The capacity indices were calculated considering the specification limits for the weight loss ratio defined for the production of 𝐿𝐼𝐸 = 0.10 and 𝐿𝑆𝐸 = 0.17, provided the capacity index values 𝐶𝑝 of 1.47 and 𝐶𝑝𝑘 of 1.15 considering the process as capable.

Taguchi Loss Function: The value of the loss coefficient (k = R$2.04) was considered low, indicating a small loss of quality.

The Statistical Quality Control techniques provided the company a better control of its production process, enabling the reduction of quality losses such as reprocessing, overweight and product disposal. This analysis enabled a greater understanding about the process performance , seeking to identify special causes and contributing to quality control.
